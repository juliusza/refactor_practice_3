# refactor_practice_3

This kitchen framework refuses to work on windows. I don't have linux env readily available. Will use travis CI. That means I need to git push every time when I want to run tests.

# Changelog

* Initialize test pipeline using travis, docker and ansible kitchen
* Add Redis and OpenResty roles from ansible galaxy
